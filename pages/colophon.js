              overengineered for a personal website, but playing with transient
              web technologies is an indulgent hobby I don't want to relinquish.
              I started building it in late 2021 and tinker on it regularly.

            <Title3>Writing and Editing Content</Title3>
            <p>
              My CMS is just a bunch of flat files and folders. When I edit
              content on here I'm just typing text and syntax into MDX and JS
              files in VS Code. There's no fancy pipeline shuttling content
              directly from my personal knowledge management database (eg.{" "}
              <TooltipLink href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</TooltipLink> or{" "}
              <TooltipLink href="https://tana.inc">Tana</TooltipLink>
              ). All my ideas start and marinate in my Tana, but I wait for them
              to mature a bit before they move over to this garden.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know other people prefer setups where they can click one button
              and push content from personal notes to the web. I personally like
              having more control over how the material is displayed and laid
              out. Working directly in the native medium of the web – HTML, CSS,
              and JavaScript – gives me fine-grained control. It allows me to
              play with typography, illustrations, graphic design, videos,
              animations, and interactive elements that pure text pipelines
              can't support. Text isn't the only way to represent ideas.

            <p>
              Every post on this site has a <b>growth stage</b> indicating how
              complete and comprehensive it is. They start as{" "}
              <SeedlingIcon width="24px" height="24px" /> seedlings, grow into{" "}
              <BuddingIcon width="24px" height="24px" /> buddings, and finally
              end up as <EvergreenIcon width="24px" height="24px" /> evergreens.
              You'll often find notes and essays that are unfinished or in
              progress. In an ideal world I'd finish everything I started. But
              we don't live there and I'm notoriously bad at leaving things half
              baked. I do cycle back though. Sometimes months or years later.
              What goes around comes around.

            <Title3>Custom Components</Title3>
            <p>
              I've built a number of reusable custom components for various
              situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's the <i>coming soon</i> component that signals a post is
              half-written and needs to be finished in the future:
              <ComingSoon />
            </p>
            <p>
              There's an <i>assumed audience</i> component that I put at the top
              of some posts to make explicit who I'm writing for:
              <Spacer size="xs" />
              <AssumedAudience>
                People who care about how websites are built.
              </AssumedAudience>
            </p>
            <Spacer size="xs" />
            <p>
              I occasionally need to <i>alert</i> readers to dangers and
              threats:
              <Alert>
                <h2>This is an alert</h2>
                <p>
                  Stay vigiliant to the threat of typography that is too small
                  and low contrast to read.
                </p>
              </Alert>
            </p>
            <p>
              Some are nicely styled callouts for books:

                and control, risk and reward.
