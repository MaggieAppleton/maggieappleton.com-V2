### June 2023

The last six months have felt like a disorientating blur. While bouncing between overseas trips, writing conference talks, organising events, and keeping up with work, I ended a long-term relationship and moved across London. My writing took a hit ‚Äì I haven't published much this year. I feel like I'm still trying to figure out what to do when I get up every morning.

Having everything thrown out of whack is pretty useful. You figure out how resilient your systems are. You learn what you have committed to muscle memory and what you rely on cues from your environment to do.

I was also reminded how much I value my extended friend network in London (and the rest of Europe). My social groups here often feel like concentric overlapping circles ‚Äì I can't neatly distinguish them. Which feels right; like a small village where everyone knows everyone. My philosophy friends show up at the [Future of Coding](https://lu.ma/foclondon) meetups I run. My Twitter friends appear at dinners with my more _woo_ creative people. It's difficult to beat the sheer density of curious, friendly, ambitious people in a big city like London. It is more than worth the price of rent IMHO.

It doesn't help that everything in the world of language models and generative AI has been moving at warp speed this year. I'm reading notes I took back in October of 2022 on GPT-3 and truthfulness, and it feels like we're in a completely different world now. The benchmarks are out of date. The prompting techniques are more sophisticated. The real-world use cases have proliferated.

I keep wanting to throw my hat into the discourse ring ‚Äì I certainly have formed opinions at this point! But there's so much noise it's difficult to determine if you're really adding any signal. I'm trying to be cautious about it. Being a careful thinker feels like a rare quality at this point; I still aspire to be one.

Some good reads as of late:

Bought myself used copies of Christopher Alexander's classics. Feels much better to hold these in your hands than scroll the PDFs.

### November 2022

It's a weird week. Twitter is (possibly) entering a slow death march and much of my community is reluctantly slouching over to Mastodon. I've started cross-posting there as well: [indieweb.social/@maggie](https://indieweb.social/@maggie). The Elon-escapades only drive home how important it is to own and control the platform you're publishing to. Which means writing on your own website first and cross-posting to external platforms. The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community has a catchy acronym for this: [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.

I still don't have a Twitter-like stream setup on this site, but I'm working on it. Tools like [WebMentions](https://webmention.io/) and [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) are going to do a lot of the heavy lifting. I'm having trouble finding many tutorials or guides on how to do it though ‚Äì perhaps another case of writing the piece you want to read.

I've been working at [Ought](https://ought.org/) since late August. The London ‚Üî SF time difference is a bit crap, but I can't say enough good things about my fellow Oughters ü¶¶. It's rare and special to work alongside such thoughtful and ambitious people. We're in the middle of designing and prototyping some wildly different interfaces for [Elicit](https://elicit.org/), our AI research assistant and Ought's main product. Users say they love the current version, but we know it could be so much better.

In other news, I bought a cheap, used laser printer and it's drastically improved my reading experience for long articles and PDFs. Can't recommend it enough. There are plenty going for ¬£30-40 on eBay and you'll finally read all those 5000-word blog posts you have bookmarked.

<BasicImage src="/images/posts/now/printer.jpeg" />

I've finally gotten back into a good writing cadence. I recently published [Programming Portals](/programming-portals) and [Command K Bars](/command-bar). Now I'm slowly chipping away at [Tools for Thought](/tools-for-thought) [as Cultural Practices,](/tools-for-thought) [Not Computational Objects](/tools-for-thought). I've been writing it forever, but that's kind of the point of [gardening](/garden-history) in public. You post up loose skeletons of ideas and flesh them out over time. Nothing forces you to write like knowing people are reading your half-baked version.

### July 2022

I've decided to joined [Ought](https://ought.org/), a non-profit research lab. I wrote about the move [here](/joining-ought), but TLDR:
Ought is exploring how machine learning techniques can support [open-ended reasoning](https://ought.org/mission) and research. At the moment their main focus is building [Elicit](https://elicit.org/) an AI research assistant that helps automate literature reviews. The long term vision is to develop tools and techniques that mitigate [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) risks. 

They're based in the bay area of California, so I'll be on flights over the Atlantic more often. London is still homebase for the longterm future. I'll spare you my gauche love letter to this city, but leaving only makes me realise how deeply I appreciate it. Stepping back onto TFL platforms, Sainsbury's aisles, and hodge-podge pavements feels like breathing again. Perhaps it's just a matter of contrasts though; San Fransisco's grimey vibes are not for me.

I've started hosting a monthly event for the [Future of Code](https://lu.ma/london-foc) community here. I'm keeping it low-key for the moment. Meaning it's just thirty people in a pub talking shop about CRDT's, spatial canvases, and embodied cognition. My kind of Friday night.

We've got an exceptional class of people coming at the moment. I'm thinking hard about how to preserve this early group energy; keeping it small, not promoting it too much (lest the recruiters and VC's get wind of the event), and maintaining the ‚Äúdon't take this too seriously‚Äù vibes. Most other tech meetups in London turn out to be overstuffed, impersonal networking evenings. They're held in some flourescently lit office where a handful of people give lightweight talks over lukewarm pizza. Everyone wants to escape home as soon as they've arrived. Avoiding this vibe is my first priority.

### October 2021

After five years working with [egghead](https://egghead.io), I decided it was time to move on. I started as an illustrator in early 2016. By 2018 I had moved into an art director and leadership role. By 2020 I'd shifted to focusing on UX and product design.

I grew up in this company, but over the last year it's become clear I need/want to enagage more in the rising ‚Äútools for thought‚Äù ecosystem. I've now joined [HASH](https://hash.ai) as the design lead. We're working on building a knowledge management platform (aka. ‚Äúnote taking app") backed by schemas and structured data.

### August 2021

With lockdown easing in London I've spent most of summer outside throwing tennis balls around in the park, rather than sitting in front of screens writing words. It's been a good break, but I've missed researching. The British winter will descend again soon and I'll be back inside tending to the digital garden.

[Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) and I finally launched [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/) after 2 years of work. It's an interactive book that teaches JavaScript with a specific focus on mental models. I created the diagrams and animations that help communicate the core concepts. We created it with the support of the egghead team who took care of logistics like email promotion, web infrastructure, and customer support.

I've become enamoured with [Visual Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language) and [End-user Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_development) over the last 6 months. The [Future of Coding](https://futureofcoding.org/) community and [Gordon Brandon](https://subconscious.substack.com/)'s newsletter have been particularly valuable hubs of insight.

Chatted to a few podcast folks;

1. Adam Wiggins and Mark McGranaghan on [Metamuse](https://museapp.com/podcast/) about visual programming.
2. Scott Francis and Evan Payne on [Frontend Heroes](https://frontendheroes.transistor.fm/) about a little bit of everything

Currently preparing a talk for two conferences in October; [React Live Conference](https://reactlive.nl/) in Amsterdam and [React Advanced](https://reactadvanced.com/) here in London. On various ways to visualise React, why visual representations work so well, the pros / cons / wicked historical problems of adding graphical and spatial affordances to programming interfaces, and why we should keep trying despite the challenges.

### September 2020

Digging into the work of [Barbara Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Tversky) and reading the literature around [embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition). I've been a long time fan of [George Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff) so much of it us familiar. Tverksy's new book [Mind in Motion](/mind-in-motion) builds off many of the same themes.

Delaying a part-time Masters degree in [Digital Anthropology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc) at UCL until next year when we'll hopefully be less Covid-y

Reading [Working in Public](/working-in-public) by Nadia Eghbal

Exploring the connections between technology and magic through the writings of [Alfred Gell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Gell). Specifically enjoyed the paper [The Technology of Enchantment and the Enchantment of Technology](http://www.xenopraxis.net/readings/gell_technologyenchantment.pdf)

Playing [Thing From the Future](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/) ‚Äì A game that challenges players to collaboratively and competitively describe objects from a range of alternative futures.
