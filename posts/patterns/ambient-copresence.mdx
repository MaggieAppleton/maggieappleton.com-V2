<h2 className="micro">The Context</h2>

Creating a subtle sense of shared, synchronous space is one of the hardest design challenges of the web.

You and I are currently in an <u><i>a</i></u>synchronous exchange. I've written these words in the past. You're reading them at some point in the future. We are not in sync.

Despite being on the same web<u><i>site</i></u> – which suggests a shared digital space – it bears very little resemblance to how we might interact in a shared physical space in real-time.

We currently have no visual, audible, tactile, spatial, or embodied awareness of one another. We also have no awareness of the other people reading this article, even if they're doing it at the exact same moment.

For a long time, the asynchronous nature of the web was a technical limitation. Internet speeds and bandwidth simply couldn't accommodate anything beyond sending reams of static text to one another with long, slow lags in between.

But things have progressed. We now take for granted that our web connections refresh every few milliseconds. We experience most of it in real-time; spicy Twitter drama, collaborative editing in Google docs, overcrowded Zoom meetings, sensationalist BBC breaking news coverage, World of Warcraft tournaments, and the flood of comments on every Twitch livestream load in the blink of an eye.

But it feels as though we haven't quite clocked what's possible here. The synchronous, multiplayer web is brand new, and the design space around it is still relatively unexplored.

Most of the web is designed for a slow-loading, single-player experience. Our personalised live streams of content give us a sense of immediacy, but they still lack everything else about shared space; directionality, subtle awareness of those around us, opportunities for ad-hoc interactions, freedom to explore, and most critically, a shared understanding we are seeing the same reality as people in our immediate vicinity. There is no '_vicinity_' when you are an individual staring down a content stream that no one else will ever see or know. 

We don't necessarily need to constantly interact with people “around” us on the web. The sensation of being in the quiet companionship of someone else, as if you're reading next to them in a cafe, is what we're missing. The sense of ambiently sharing space – of being co-present – while engaged in other activities is a staple of shared public spaces that we're still figuring out how to design in the digital realm.

Our current “multiplayer” experiences draw too much attention to the multiplayer-ness. The other people around you demand attention. They move. They animate. They point to exactly what they're focused on, drawing you away from your own focal point. We are missing out on a fuzzier, softer sense of the shared web.

<h2 className="micro">The Pattern</h2>

Ambient co-presence is the sensation of sharing a space or context with other people, without directly interacting or continuously communicating with them. You're all aware of each other through peripheral vision, ambient noise, and embodied sensations but aren't necessarily doing the same tasks or directing your attention to the same things.

This looks like quietly reading on the back porch with family, sitting in a cafe full of people softly chatting or tapping away at laptops, or people watching from a shabby seat on the London underground, marvelling at the vast array of people that can exist in a single space.

The others rarely demand your attention or strike up conversations. They just exist nearby, unobtrusively doing whatever they're doing. Providing companionship, comfort, and small windows of insight into how others choose to show up in the world and spend their time.

#### Multiplayer Cursors

Our current digital attempt at this is the multiplayer cursor. Other people who have access to your file are visible in the interface. Usually as small, pointy, colourful cursors or highlighted text selections. Sometimes with little names or floating profile pictures next to them to help identify people.

AFAIK Google Docs was the first to implement this, quickly followed by everyone else. Notion, Figma, Miro, and most other collaborative platforms use this pattern.

This adds a sense of shared activity in digital spaces but lacks the ambient quality we're seeking. Seeing _exactly_ which word or design mock your manager is focused on isn't the chill background sensation we're going for.

They also don't scale. Having hundreds of individual cursors zooming around an interface quickly feels overwhelming. Anyone who has been in a massive shared Google Doc or Figma file knows this sensation well. They're clearly designed for smaller-scale, closed contexts like private teams and internal work. 

To scale this sensation of sensing others in a workspace without being distracted by them, we could turn the pointy, specific, animated cursor into a softer, fuzzier hint of presence. More like a heatmap.

#### Ambient Sound

Ambient sounds feel like one of the most promising avenues to explore here. Sound naturally follows a spatial gradient in physical space; people close to you are louder, and people further away are quieter, with many shades in between.

This gives us some flexibility between private and public conversations. We can move in and out of earshot of other people, or enjoy the low hum of other voices in larger spaces without being distracted.

Two projects have done this well in digital space:

1. [Gather Town](https://www.gather.town/) is a “digital space for distributed teams” which I've seen used for everything from unconferences to team retreats. You appear as a game-like character in a fake living room or office, and can then move around the space.

The clever bit here is the video and audio channels of people around you fade in and out as you move closer and further from them. You're able to move around a room and jump between conversational groups, just like at a cocktail party.

2. [Cozyroom](https://cozyroom.xyz/) is more of a prototype, but is specifically designed to explore spatial audio. You appear as a little blobby character on screen who can talk. As you move near people, their audio volume increases. You can also draw bounded areas
