<IntroParagraph>

Andrej Karpathy, AI industry heavyweight, co-founder of OpenAI, and [charmingly](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1599152286672248832?s=20) [relatable](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1504975036037406722?s=20) [Twitter personality](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1576057698092580864?s=20), was the first to call AI an “alien”.

</IntroParagraph>

Back in November of 2022, Karpathy went on on [Lex Friedman's podcast](https://youtu.be/cdiD-9MMpb0?si=wm7V0IZuaOltv0vn&t=395) and said “I of think of [neural networks] as a very complicated alien artefact.”

From this moment on, “aliens” became the metaphor du jour for thought leaders, micro-influencers, and everyday laypeople trying to fumble their way through philosophical discussions on what ChatGPT _means_.

Stephen Wolfram claimed that “in AI we finally have an accessible form of alien mind” while describing how generative images are produced in [Generative AI Space and the Mental Imagery of Alien Minds](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/07/generative-ai-space-and-the-mental-imagery-of-alien-minds/)

Simon Willison opened his talk on [Making Large Language Models work for you](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/27/wordcamp-llms/) with a classical bright green-eyed tiny man. Then aptly described our current bewilderment with language models: “It feels like three years ago, aliens showed up on Earth, handed us a USB stick with this thing on and then departed. And we’ve been poking at it ever since and trying to figure out what it can do.”

Tom Stafford used stronger language in saying “these models behave like human intelligence, but they are really a form of alien minds” in [Artifical reasoners as alien minds](https://tomstafford.substack.com/p/artificial-reasoners-as-alien-minds).

We're starting to get quite literal with these analogies.

The AI-is-an-alien comparison hit a peak last month when the [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/ai/six-month-letter-expires/) had a smorgasbord of talking heads write open letters reflecting on AI risk. Among them, Stewart Russell, genuine AI legend, and Yuval Noah Harari, nothing-to-do-with-AI-historian-pretending-to-be-an-anthropologist, both heavily used the alien metaphor:

<BlockquoteCitation author="Stewart Russell">
“To express my frustration with this, I made up a fictitious email exchange, where a superior alien civilization sends an email to humanity warning of its impending arrival, and humanity sends back an out-of-office auto-reply. After the pause letter, humanity and its governments returned to the office and, finally, read the email from the aliens.”
</BlockquoteCitation>

<BlockquoteCitation author="Yuval Noah Harari">
“Suppose we were told that a fleet of spaceships with highly intelligent aliens has been spotted, heading for Earth, and they will be here in a few years. Suppose we were told these aliens might solve climate change and cure cancer, but they might also enslave or even exterminate us. How would we react to such news? Well, six months ago some of the world's leading AI experts warned us that an alien intelligence is indeed heading our way – only that this alien intelligence isn’t coming from outer space, it is coming from our own laboratories. Make no mistake: AI is an alien intelligence. It can make decisions and create ideas in a radically different way than human intelligence. AI has enormous positive potential, but it also poses enormous threats. We must act now to ensure that AI is developed in a safe way, or within a few years we might lose control of our planet and our future to an alien intelligence”

It seems as though our discourse around neural networks and generative models has been invaded by aliens.

## The Makings of a Good Metaphor

The wild success of this metaphor is partially due to Karpathy commanding his own gravitational force in the industry. But it also does what good metaphors do: it focuses our attention on a set of key qualities. In this case, neural networks as “aliens” points to:

- How little we understand about them
- Their capacity for human-level intelligence and beyond
- A sense of unknowable otherness
- A reasonable amount of fear
- Seeing them as a potential risk or threat
- A need for more research and exploration

Aliens were an easy hook. They're firmly established in our cultural history. It gave us all a familiar conceptual frame to grasp in a moment of obscene hype, fear, and a mad scramble to understand these new generative AI systems.

And yet the first metaphor is rarely the best metaphor.

While we're in the early stages of writing the cultural narrative around AI, it is worth taking our metaphor-making activities seriously and exploring the full range of how we should think about these new systems and their capabilities.

The metaphor we choose will lay the groundwork for how we build, design, and deploy them in the world.

I am very uncertain about proceeding into this future with the visceral image of a shrivelled, slime-drenched, screeching phallic creature bursting from a man's chest and then proceeding to consume the humans around it as our guiding metaphorical light.

But if not aliens, then what? What metaphors better capture the qualities of neural networks and the generative AI systems they produce?

## Metaphorical Gravity

The metaphors we design with become embedded into our infrastructure.

The desktop metaphor trapped us all in a white-collar knowledge work office forever. We are doomed to relate to compuaters as digital stacks of papers, covered in sticky notes, with tiny images papercliped to them, populated by pedantic editors pointing out every last grammatical error.
