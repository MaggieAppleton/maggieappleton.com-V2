<IntroParagraph>

My parents went through a phase of gifting finely painted novelty oil portraits to our family members. It started with my two aunts turning forty. We gave them portraits of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth. But with their faces painted in.

Next they gave my grandparents the famous 'Luncheon of the Boat Party' painting. But with the cast of characters replaced by our family members.

We were living in Saigon, Vietnam at the time and getting custom paintings made was easy and fairly cheap. There are whole streets in the city where [skilled painters](https://flyicarusfly.com/vietnam-art-reproduction/) sit outdoors [making and selling](http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/art-entertainment/53436/flourishing-market-for-art-reproduction-in-vietnam.html) re-creations of classical art pieces.

The naff novelty of these made them funny. Having a large painted portrait of yourself feels out of place in the 21st century. A bit like LARPing as a member of the 16th-century royal court.

Scarcity also makes these special. Outside of small, strange marketplaces like Vietnam, very few people have the skills to re-create an old masterpiece with your face in it.

At least up until now.

With the advent of photography, older technologies like realistic portrait painting become rare and special.

First, photography made realistic portraiture cheap. Then smartphones made access to high-quality cameras cheap. Now generative portraits are making aesthetics cheap.

We don't have any physical representations of the vast majority of humans on
earth. Before 3000 BCE we weren't in the habit of capturing people's
likenesses. The Egyptians did it first, closely followed by the Romans and
Greeks. Once we did develop a taste for representation we still only captured
“important” people – royals, nobles, and the wealthy. Everyone else died
without visual documentation.

That realisation feels absurd in the age of the selfie, the always-on zoom camera, and the 8-megapixel cameras living in our pockets. We are all excessively documented.
