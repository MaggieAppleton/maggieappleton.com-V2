<IntroParagraph>

My parents went through a phase of gifting finely painted novelty oil portraits to our family members. It started with my two aunts turning forty. We gave them portraits of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth. But with their faces painted in.

Next they gave my grandparents the famous 'Luncheon of the Boat Party' painting. But with the cast of characters replaced by our family members.

We were living in Saigon, Vietnam at the time and getting custom paintings made was easy and fairly cheap. There are whole streets in the city where [skilled painters](https://flyicarusfly.com/vietnam-art-reproduction/) sit outdoors [making and selling](http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/art-entertainment/53436/flourishing-market-for-art-reproduction-in-vietnam.html) re-creations of classical art pieces.

The naff novelty of these made them funny. Having a large painted portrait of yourself feels out of place in the 21st century. A bit like LARPing as a member of the 16th-century royal court.

Scarcity also makes these special. Outside of small, strange marketplaces like Vietnam, very few people have the skills to re-create an old masterpiece with your face in it.

At least up until now.

With the advent of photography, older technologies like realistic portrait painting become rare and special.

First, photography made realistic portraiture cheap. Then smartphones made access to high-quality cameras cheap. Now generative portraits are making aesthetics cheap.

We don't have any physical representations of the vast majority of humans on
earth. Before 3000 BCE we weren't in the habit of capturing people's
likenesses. The Egyptians did it first, closely followed by the Romans and
Greeks. Once we did develop a taste for representation we still only captured
“important” people – royals, nobles, and the wealthy. Everyone else died
without visual documentation.

That realisation feels absurd in the age of the selfie, the always-on zoom camera, and the 8-megapixel cameras living in our pockets. We are all excessively documented.

[Passphoto.ai](https://passphoto.ai/) generates a photographic image that passes the requirements for passport photos.

## Photography Isn't Dead Yet

I recently paid a human to take fancy photos of me. This felt indulgent but necessary. A dozen times a year I go on a podcast or do a conference talk and I get asked for a photo. I always send the same image:

This was taken five years ago and I've frankly aged out of it. The replacements are much nicer. I'm thrilled with them. They have just the right balance of awkwardness and smirk that I give off IRL.

My photographer (who was _fantastic_ and I highly recommend going to him if you are in London and need photos done) heard I worked in AI and asked if he should be worried about the advancements in image generators. I said yes, within 1-3 years, I expect fine tuning a model on your face and generating portraits as good as these seems plausible.

I expect there to still be a market for human photographers for authenticity's sake. If models can generate photos, I expect it's a small hop over to asking the model to make your nose smaller, remove a few wrinkles, and plump your lips. The [TikTok]() filters are already in the wild. At what point does it undermine the whole point of a photo? An artefact made to capture your real likeness.

For industries like acting, there could be a premium put on getting real headshots that capture your genuine likeness. We could have certified IRL photographers.
