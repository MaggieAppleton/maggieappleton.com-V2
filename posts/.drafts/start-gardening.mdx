<AssumedAudience>

People with some web development experience interested in building a space online to cultivate their ideas slowly over time. One they fully own and contol, independent of proprietary social media platforms and their algorithms.

<IntroParagraph>

Enough people have asked me to write this piece that I eventually had to cave.<Footnote idName={1} isClosed> I've been reluctant to do so, because writing about digital gardening on a digital garden feels a bit like a myopic circle jerk. I promise I have other interests and concerns, but for some reason can't escape this one.</Footnote> Three years ago, I published a long essay on the history and ethos of [[digital gardening]]. Since then, I've become a magnet for people asking for practical advice on how to build their own digital garden.

</IntroParagraph>

The trouble is, the answer to “how do I build my own digital garden?” is both ”it depends” and ”it's complicated.” It depends on how much you know about web development. It depends on why you want to create a garden in the first place. It depends on your design skills. It depends on how much control and ownership you're comfortable handing over to a proprietary platform.

This piece contains all the advice I have about setting up your own digital garden. It's for people who have _some_ web development experience, or are willing to learn some web development. If that's not you, I have a seperate note on [[Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks]].

## What is a Digital Garden?

First, lets make sure we're on the same page about the definition of a “digital garden.” A garden is a _public_ website where you publish ideas, and slowly develop them over time. That's it. That's the whole definition.

It is not built on a particular platform or app. It doesn't have to include specific features like backlinks, hover links, or growth stages. It is essentially a blog, but with less focus on the chronological order that posts were written in. Blog stands for "web log", meaning a chronological log of events or ideas you have. Gardens are non-chronological. You write ideas, connect them together, and present them based on themes and their relationship to one another. It's a topography, not a stream.

## On Goals

I'm going to make some generous assumptions about why you want to build a garden. I assume you're motivated by creating a space for personal reflection, idea development, researching topics that interest you, and sharing your knowledge with other people.

#### Assumed goals

- Help other people by sharing your knowledge and experience
- Show up authentically as yourself
- Develop your ideas
- Learn new things
- Make friends

These are all good and virtous goals. They're the primary reasons I built and maintain this garden. I recommend them. There are also some goals I'm assuming you don't have.

#### Assumed non-goals

- Build an elaborate piece of engineering architecture
- Get thousands of Twitter / Instagram followers
- Become famous
- Make money

I don't know how to do any of these things well, and I'm not trying to, so can't advise you on them.

It's good to be clear on your goals up front, because buidling a garden is an involved endeavour. You're going to sink many hours into it, and you should damn well know why you're doing it.

## Information Architecture and Ontologies


## Technical Infrastructure

Alright, so you have a well-mapped set of _things_ you want to put in your garden. How do you do this?

If you have no programming or web development experience, and don't _want_ to learn more about web development, head on over to my guide to [[gardening for non-technical people]].

From this point on you'll need to know how to use:

- The command line
- Some Git
- Github

Some considerations:

- Independence – you need to own and control your own work
- Longevity – design something you plan to use for 50 years
- Simplicity – you're doing this to develop your ideas, not build the engineering architecure of the gods

## Static Site Generators

Static site generators an ideal technology for building gardens.

They take in a set of files: content and templates, and create HTML pages.

"Static websites consist of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to the user's browser. Static sites can handle high traffic volumes with minimal server resources, making them highly scalable"

### Picking an SSG

Frankly, I think there are only three generators you should consider: [Hugo](#), [Jekyll](#), and [Eleventy](#). There are others, but they're unnessecarily complex for building a garden.

I know this first-hand because I build my first garden in [Gatsby](#), and my current one in [Next.js](#), which are both terrible choices. I did this because I'm an inexperienced, mediocre engineer, and I was choosing frameworks I was already familiar with from professional contexts. Gatsby and Next are good choices if you're building a SaaS app, but not a garden. Total overkill and extra complexity. Don't make my mistakes.
