## Part Three - Creative Play

Now that we have some interesting ingredients on the page we get to start playing.

There's a large canon of work around intentional creative thinking that's worth digging into.

Edward de Bono's Lateral Thinking and Serious Creativity had an enourmous influence on me.

###### He's written too many books at this point (which frankly are mostly just glorified remixes of the original idea), so I'd suggest only looking at the original ones: Serious Creativity and Lateral Thinking

Alex Osborn's Applied Imagination

Thinkertoys by Michel Mikalo is summary of many of the techniques proneered by de Bono, Osborn, and other.

I use these all interchangeably, but there's no _one true way_. For this post I'm just going to focus on my favourite – SCAMPER

This one came from Alex Osborn and is an acronymn for seven remixing techniques;
Substitute
Combine
Adapt
Maximise or minimise
Eliminate
Put to other uses
Rearrange or reverse

[Add printable cheatsheet on SCAMPER]

Look at our list of web security "ingredients" and start mashing them together.

Here's some more tangible examples of each

### Substitute

Keyboard keys for castle bricks

### Combine

HTTPS letters for padlock dials

### Adapt

### Maximise or Minimize

### Put to Other Uses

### Eliminate

Now our brainstorming page has significantly expanded.

It's probably hard to see all the bits going on here, but you can [zoom around the big version here](./Big-sketches.png)

Let's pull out some of the more interesting sketches and see how they're using SCAMPER (or not)

These are all good examples of **substitue** and **combine** which are the bread and butter of SCAMPER

For a minute I got really into making the arrow pointer icon attack various things

The gift of the term "cookie" in web security is too good to pass up so spent a good while trying to mash up cookie references.
This veered into metaphorical blending when added in the association with "phising" which gives us fishing hooks to spear all the delicious cookies with

![](cookies.png)

For some reason mixed metaphors have a bad reputation. As if combining two or more leads to some impure mix.
To me that's completely nonsense.
In fact we're all incredibly good at mixing metaphors in logical and consistent ways. There's been good research done around this phenomenon of **blended metaphor**

[Lakoff theory in here]

If a concept reads it reads. Mix all the things!

### Tiny Visual Stories

While running through these remix exercises I'm also thinking of all these as "mini-scenes"
Or perhaps "visual stories"

Each of these has a character, doing an action, in a scene.
So the web browser and the aggressive click icons are the characters, doing the action of x, in the landscape of the internet.

## Judgement Day

Now comes the tough part – looking at the sprawl of bad ideas and make hard judgements about what ones are actually worth developing as proper solutions to our original goal.
