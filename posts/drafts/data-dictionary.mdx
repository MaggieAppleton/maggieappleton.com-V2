Our portrait of data right now is that giant wall of falling 0's and 1's the Matrix burned onto our eyeballs. We only ever hear about "big data," which true to it's name overshadows all the other types.

Data isn't a monolithic blob of indistinguishable  numbers.
It certainly isn't to the people who know the most about it. They're inventing a pile of rich and strange words, analogies, and metaphors to talk about it. Proving there are many different kinds and ways of thinking about data.

Learning the see data the way data scientists, analysts, and 'consultants' feels critical. Primarily if we want any shot at _data soverignty_ and agency in the growing influence of data over our lives.

This is a foray into making data less boring and befuddling. And more visible, tangible, and real for you.
