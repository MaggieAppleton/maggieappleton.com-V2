<IntroParagraph>

The web began as enhanced paper. Tim Berners-Lee pitched the web as an easier way to share research papers – long reams of text that were otherwise being handed around on physical sheets.

</IntroParagraph>

This paper-based beginning defined the way the web unfolded. For starters, it established the **page** as the fundamental unit of the web. We build at the page level, link at the page level, and think at the page level. <Footnote idName={1}>Sure, we also use the term "site" or "app" to refer to an entire domain name on the web, but the individual URLs we link to are still "pages".</Footnote>

This "digital paper" was designed as a text-first environment – all other forms of media came second. Images, videos, and audio are all treated as special "inline" interactive elements we bury amongst the words.

Our [modern design metaphors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design) mimic paper products like index cards and sheets stacked on top of each other. Our pages are white, our text is black, and our typographic tactics come straight from the world of print.

So the paper-origins of the web are still apparent. But we've also moved well beyond our founding metaphor. Over the last two decades, the capacities of a webpage have far surpassed what paper is capable of.

We flick through TikToks, react to InstaSnap stories, explore street-level maps of cities, scroll through rich 3D interactive articles, programme in [playgrounds](https://observablehq.com/), grow crops in Farmville <Footnote idName={2}>An outdated example, but the mass exodus of games from the web makes it hard to point to a canonical gaming experience in the browser. The browser is certainly capable of running interactive games, but the gaming industry has sensibly moved over to native platforms.</Footnote>, and build [explorable explainers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorable_explanation). The web has grown up to become the [dynamic medium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOdP2Bmieg) we always wanted.

This has all become so normalised, we forget that barely two decades ago the browser was still a reasonably humble document reader. No canvas, no WebGL, no 3D animations coordinating thousands of data points, no real-time updates, no _microfrontends_, no single-page web apps. We are all web babies stumbling around in this weird new medium.
