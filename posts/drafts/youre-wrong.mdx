<IntroParagraph>

I am often wrong on this website. There are various ways I'm wrong. The most common is that I spell things incorectly, or type inaccurately. Leaving incoherent gaps sentences. 

</IntroParagraph>

For every post, I put up I get somewhere in the range of 2-8 Twitter DM's and emails pointing out typos, corrections, and grammatical missteps. I appreciate people who take the time to point these mistakes out. But if I'm honest, I don't always fix them. I have a hard time willing myself to care enough if the error doesn't prevent people from understanding my main point.

I started reflecting on how to set up a system that would satisfy both my laziness _and_ the people who really want the words they read to be Correct. What if they could click a button to submit a correction?

That's possible! There's a fairly simple way to do this with GitHub pull requests. The website is [open source](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/maggieappleton.com-V2) and hosted on GitHub. Anyone can submit a PR to change what's written here. Great! I started prototyping a 1-click typo fixer.

But then I started thinking about all the other ways I'm wrong.

I'm not just wrong about small things like tpyos. I am sometimes factually wrong. In the past, I've provided the wrong year for a historical event, failed to mention a major contributor on a project, and said a [piece of artwork](/folk-interfaces) was Czech when it was actually Slovak.

I care much more about these types of mistakes. Not misleading people is fairly high on my list of goals for this [[garden]]. This typo-fixer button would have to cover situations that required larger factual revisions.

Factual errors are still fairly small fish though. There's a much larger level of wrongness I started to consider: my opinions and conclusions are sometimes wrong.

The word ‚Äúwrong‚Äù can begin to feel a bit dicey once we start talking about matters of opinion and debate. So it's helpful to point out the specific kinds of wrongness I'm thinking about here:
- I sometimes fail to support my arguments with sufficient evidence
- I sometimes don't understand the larger historical context my arguments live within
- I sometimes don't know about an important piece of history, intellectual tradition, or body of work that would alter my conclusions
- I sometimes fail to consider important counter-arguments and give them sufficient weight

These are all cases where I most certainly _want_ to be told when I'm wrong.

[I usually learn about these flaws in my arguments in indirect ways. Primarily through the comments section on Hacker News ‚Äì the holy ground of no holds critique. Other times I find quote tweets of my work outlining all the ways I've failed to understand the historical context around a topic.]

[I would love a more direct way for people to tell me I'm wrong. I have no illusions about my experience level. It's difficult to disagree with someone without coming off harshly. I assume 90% of people who realise I'm wrong in some way don't feel they have a reasonable channel to voice that critique. It is only the bold 10% who send a full response essay in Twitter DM's. And ones that do usually fail to frame it in a way that makes me want to engage in discussion. For example, I've only received these long critique responses from accounts with male profile pictures, little public online presence, and no record of writing and thinking in public themselves. ]

[Like many others who write online, I've defaulted to soliciting draft reads from people I trust the opinion of]

This leads us to a much more complex question: how can I design an experience that gives readers a way to engage in constructive critique and debate with my ideas?

On the trad web we had the comments section. But I don't have to say much about the type of conversation anonymous comments sections [manifest?]
