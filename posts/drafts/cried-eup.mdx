<IntroParagraph>

E[nd-user programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_development) has come to feel like a broken promise. For over six decades people have been dreaming up programming languages, educational philosophies, and interfaces designed to let normies<Footnote idName={1}>Normies here means people who aren't professional programmers and don't have a high level of computer literacy. I've also seen the term “muggles” used. All said with respectful love.</Footnote> create their own software.

</IntroParagraph>

The bold vision is that anyone – your mum, your dental hygienist, your favourite cast member of Love Island – should be able to create and modify their own computing environment, without needing to learn elaborate syntax or complex languages. They should be able to whip up custom apps that do whatever they need, using tools that can be learned in a few hours.

These normies shouldn't be subject to the whims of developers and product managers who decide what software gets built, what features are prioritised, and what ways of being in and seeing the world get codified into automated systems. Their unique needs will never be met by generic mass-market software, designed by people who don't understand their world. They should have a set of powerful primitives to build things themselves.

This is a good dream. It's all about democratising computational power and giving people tools to solve their own unique problems. 

But we haven't quite nailed it yet.

We've tried lots of things: graphical user interfaces, spreadsheets, visual programming, and low/no code interfaces. These have generally been quite successful. Each new paradigm transfered slightly more power from developers to end-users. We've made more and more affordances available via friendly interfaces and sophisticated abstractions, rather than mysterious and cumbersome CLI commands.

Projects like [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard), [VisiCalc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc), [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(.NET)), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Yahoo Pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), and [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) have all shifted the Overton window. They've changed people's perception of how much complexity end-users can handle, and how much power we can give them without risking catastrophic consequences like data loss or security breaches.

Even so, we are still a far cry from normies being able to build a custom website, code up their own app, or modify their favourite software without investing hundreds of hours into learning to code.

## Language Model Promises

At this point, the end-user programming community is a sceptical bunch. Most seem unperturbed by the developments in large language models over the last six months. Or at least unconvinced they'll put a significant dent in the problem.

[Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts) sums up the vibe here.

While I appreciate the critical stance, it's still worth asking whether the state of end-user programming has changed.

Large language models are exceptionally good at generating snippets of complex, working code from natural language requests.

In [A Small Matter of Programming](), the book that coined the very phrase “end-user programming” Bonnie Nardi writes:

> “Researchers have been promis­ing for quite some time that very soon communicating with computers won't be a problem because we will just talk to them the way we talk to one another. If this were to happen, the entire problem of end user programming would vanish.”
