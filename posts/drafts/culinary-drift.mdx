<IntroParagraph>

Many of the beloved staples of American cuisine are falsely attributed to nations who have almost nothing to do with them.

</IntroParagraph>

The vast majority of people in England have never eaten an english muffin, which is something like a mushy, deflated [crumpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumpet).

No Russian puts [russian dressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_dressing) on their salad. They don't even seem to eat much salad in the classic lettuce-cucumber-tomatoes sense. [Their salads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_salad) are hefty mounds of potato, egg, ham, pickle, and mayonnaise.

Italians do not serve italian wedding soup at their family gatherings.

You can't get chinese fortune cookies in China, because they were invented in California and have never become popular in their nominal homeland.

German bakeries won't sell you [german chocolate cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_chocolate_cake), a rich bake topped with pecans and coconut. Not exactly local produce in Western Europe. A housewife in Dallas, Texas, where pecans grow plentifully, came up with the recipe.

The Americans are not the only ones who do this, though they have a particular penchant for it as a slightly lost nation of immigrants hungry for cultural heritage.

Hawaiian restuarants do not have hawaiian pizza on their menus, because [a Greek guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Panopoulos) in Ontario made it up.

British people eat something called [Swedish Glace](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/295228677) which is a soft vegan ice cream that no Swedish person knows about.

We also came up with indian “curry” which isn't a thing Indians would recognise. It's just a catch-all  name that colonial women used to sweep a wide array of local dishes under one rug. They then drowned that rug in cream, butter, and sugar to make it palatable to a population with no tolerance for spice.
