<IntroParagraph>

This is a weird smörgåsbord of reflections on the first 20 weeks (halfway!) of being pregnant with my first child. Having never grown a human before, and spent very little time around others growing humans, the last five months have been a consistent parade of surprises.

</IntroParagraph>

## Living with Schrödinger's Baby

For the first few months of being pregnant, you have to assume you are both pregnant and not pregnant. You would think this would be more clear cut. Surely pregnant means pregnant? Apparently not.

There's a relatively high chance of miscarriage within the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy. Most actually happen before the 7th week (95% based on [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18310375/)), but 12 weeks is the accepted metric. This risk of loss decreases sharply week-by-week, but to play it safe, everyone tells you not to spread the news until after this milestone. Lest you have to awkwardly message people later to announce the baby party is cancelled. A good rule of thumb is don't tell anyone you don't text on a day-to-day basis.

For the nervous among us who like to seek comfort in statistics, this [pregnancy loss calculator](https://datayze.com/miscarriage-reassurer) comes in handy.

Once you're past the 12 week mark, you may officially have a baby, but you don't necessarily have a healthy and functioning baby. For that you have to wait until the 20 week mark when you get a full anatomy scan and learn that all of baby's limbs and organs are in good working order.

I began to refer to this whole situation as being pregnant with Schrödinger's baby. You both have a baby and do not have a baby. You have to make plans that assume there will be a baby in your life within the next 4-6 months – such as telling work, figuring out where a crib might go, making a budget, strategising childcare, and begin researching how to keep a baby alive – but simultaneously not get too emotionally attached to the idea of actually having a baby.

This pretending to not-be-entirely-pregnant is made complex by the fact you first go through the potentially debilitating experience of all-day-all-the-time ”morning” sickness at the start of this period, and become visibly pregnant towards the end of it. This is a good exercise in holding two contradictory truths in your mind at once. A bit like a [zen koan](https://ashidakim.com/zenkoans).

## Evolution Doesn't Care About Your Comfort

Before pregnancy, I had some fuzzy, semi-spiritual belief that the long and magical process of evolution was on my side and always served my best interests. Even if our bodies have [their quirks](https://www.sdbonline.org/sites/fly/lewheldquirk/figlegq6.htm), they've been molded by millions of years of evolution to keep us alive and thriving in earthly environments.

But “alive”, doesn't mean happy, comfortable, or feeling like you've bathed in stardust. Evolution is perfectly fine with you feeling like you've been sucked into a dark, joyless black hole of nausea and fatigue – as long as you're alive while there. As long as you reproduce and the offspring survive, it doesn't matter whether you suffer through the process. Natural selection is indifferent to your misery.

This sums up my experience of “morning sickness” in the first trimester. Based on depictions on television and film, I expected to promptly throw up each morning after smelling a particularly strong coffee, and then proceed with my day as usual.

I did not expect to feel permanently carsick and chronically exhausted from 6am to 6pm, every day, for 8 weeks. This turned out to be fairly debilitating for everyday tasks. Fittingly for stepping into parenthood, I had to start holding my notion of “the kind of person I am” very lightly. Pre-pregnancy-sickness, I had a bunch of moral-high-ground-ideas about the kind of standards I hold myself to on a daily basis.

I thought I was the kind of person who exercised 4+ times a week. And the kind of person who eats large volumes of nutritious vegetables and whole foods. And the kind of person who spends time outside of work creating stuff; writing, drawing, and building things with code.

But I promptly stopped being this kind of person. I exercised 0.3 times a week. The few times I tried to go on runs, it felt like dragging a lead body around. I did not want vegetables in the same room as me. I ate nothing but salt & vinegar crisps, oven chips, marmite toast, and instant noodles. On good days I could do cheese on crackers and [meal deal sandwiches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal_deal). The overriding theme was heavily processed carbs with lots of salt.

In every moment outside of work, I napped, or else I curled myself into a small ball on the sofa and watched hours of TikTok about how to be pregnant and what babies are. I would occasionally take breaks to retch up stomach acid or fetch more crackers to nibble on. I made nothing. I exercised no creativity. I transformed into a very tired, nauseous blob unwilling to do much of anything.

As far as evolution is concerned, this was all fine. I was still alive and healthy and going to reproduce. No biological adjustments needed. Perhaps in an earlier millenia, this amount of sickness would have been disruptive to gathering enough food or running away from predators. But now that we've eliminated those kinds of environmental pressures, we're not really selecting against people with debilitating morning sickness and slowly reducing it's presence. Which I'm thankful for! Because I wouldn't be long for this world. And I should point out than on the scale of severity, mine was pretty middle-of-the-road. Some women get [extreme sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperemesis_gravidarum) and end up hospitalised from dehydration and malnutrition.

Rather than being a trait to select again, some scientists believe that throwing up everything that isn't a dry cracker is actually evolutionarily productive and protective. The [theory goes](https://arc.net/l/quote/fwoaekfw) that chronic nausea prevents women consuming toxins or harmful substances at a time when the fetus is most vulnerable (the first few months). Aversions to foods like meat, eggs, dairy, and vegetables has some sensible basis since these are more likely to carry bacteria and parasites than my beloved salt & vinegar crisps ([Flaxman 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10858967/)). The same goes for the potentially toxic effects of caffiene, smoking, and alcohol.

## Relatively Fruity Babies

Someone, somewhere once decided the best way to help expecting parents understand the size of their growing child was to compare it to an escalating array of fruits and vegetables. Ever since, this has become the global standard in every last pregnancy guide and app.

Each week you get a produce update. Last week, an avocado, this week, an artichoke, next week, a mango, the week after, a sweet potato. Despite the widespread prevalence of this cute and helpful set of comparisons, there is, shockingly, no standardised fruit schedule for everyone to align to. Each app picks a completely different arbitrary plant each week.

I just need to point out there's an _enourmous_ opportunity here to someone to propose a standardised fruit comparison schedule for everyone to align to and end the chaos. It's probably not a lucrative economic opportunity but I'm sure you'll get lots of scientific street cred for it.

Produce relativism also becomes a problem. Being told your baby is the size of a cucumber begs the question, "what kind of cucumber?". A cucumber can be anywhere from 10-40cm depending on the cucumber. Are we talking Persian cucumbers? Hothouses? Marketmores?

Suffice to say I haven't found the fruit comparisons particularly helpful for visualising how the baby is coming along, but appreciate there aren't many other categories of objects in the world we could swap it out for. Comparisons to animals would be too taboo. Household objects are too inert and objectifying. And “your baby is a whisk this week” doesn't have the same cuteness factor.

## Unconscious Expertise

A few weeks ago I grew a kidney. I haven't a clue how. If you asked the conscious, problem-solving, goal-directed, “intelligent” pre-frontal cortex part of me how to grow a kidney, she wouldn't have a good answer.

## Gender Trouble

## Pregnancy Before Pixels

Once I started talking to the seasoned women of my family about their pregancy experiences – my mother, mother-in-law, and still-kicking-94-year-old grandmother – terrifying stories quickly emerged. Not of birth pain or devasating losses. But simply of the standard of maternity care, available medical knowledge, legal rights, and technical capabilites available to pregnant women only 30-50 years ago.

Some of these generational differences of opinion are endearing; both my mother and grandmother are concerned I'm continuing to workout throughout pregnancy. They suggested running might make the baby too used to bouncing movements. It might demand constant bobbing upon arrival. Or become one of those intolerable hyperactive children. Weight lifting might stress the baby out or accidently pop it out too early.

These worries sort of make logical sense. In their day, pregnancy was a time for quiet rest, not sprinting around. But the glory of science is we sometimes discover our intuitions are wrong. Studies overwhelmingly show doing cardiovascular exercise and strength training throughout pregnancy both have huge positive outcomes for both mother and child. Improved bone density. Improved stress levels. Improved newborn growth and neurodevelopment. Fewer cesaraian sections. Shorter recovery times after birth. Lower risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, postnatal depression, and pelvic floor disorders. (<AcademicReference

If this was a drug, we'd give it to every pregnant woman for free.

Access to scientific research and medical insight was sparse across the board. My parents, born in the late 1950s and early 60s, never had ultrasounds done of them in the womb. Because ultrasounds, the primary way we check that babies are alive and have all ten fingers and toes, a beating heart, intact spinal cords, the right number of kidneys, and limbs where they should be, weren't widely available [until the 1970s](https://arc.net/l/quote/rfablldz).

My grandmothers had no way of knowing if the child inside of them had a serious disablitity or medical issue. They had no way to check for chromosomal abnormalities like Down's Syndrome. Let alone the baby's sex ahead of time – something we can find out today at only 6 weeks in with a £90 [blood test](https://sneakpeektest.com/). Both told stories of pregnancy being a time of terrible worry and concern. Of being beside themselves thinking they might give birth to a stillborn, or a severely disabled child to care for on top of their existing children, and no choice in the matter.

The differences in outcomes between their generation and mine is staggering. If we compare 2024 to 1960, stillbirth rates have dropped by [nearly half](https://www.cdc.gov/stillbirth/data-research/index.html). Infant mortaility has [dropped by 79%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm). Maternal mortality is [down 52%](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-brief-report/2020/dec/maternal-mortality-united-states-primer).

Statistics are nice but what strikes me is the emotional difference in how I'm able to experience pregnancy versus the uncertainty and anxiety they had to endure.

Unlike my grandmothers, I've been given a flood of reassuring information to help me adjust my expectations to the reality of my pregnancy. I have seen my baby kick and flail its arms on a small video screen. I've had blood tests to check for concerning chromosomal issues. An experienced sonographer has measured the length of every major bone in my baby's body, it's heart chambers, and lung capacity. A kindly midwife regularly checks my vitals and mental health to ensure I'm doing as well as the baby is.

Even so, my experience is still brimming with the possibility of loss. From the beginning that has been clear. The minute you realise you've been cosmically promised a tiny, perfect, unbearably lovely child to care for, you suddenly realise all the ways that can be taken away from you. Rare diseases. Unforseen complications. Forseen complications. Traumatic births. Random chance.

While modern medicine can't prevent every last prenatal tragedy, it can see far more of them coming down the pike, and prepare parents for difficult realities. And more importantly, medically intervene or give them choices ahead of time. Choices that are astonishingly being taken away from parents in increasingly medieval and oppressive countries like the United States. Weird to say, but god bless the United Kingdom <span role="img">🇬🇧</span>

My pregnancy isn't marked by fear and worry about the health of my child, or my own survival through this process, in the way my grandmothers were. My doctors and midwives not only care for me, but grant me the right to make choices about my own body and child. In ways my grandmothers weren't given choices or cared for at all. Before we realised pregnant women might need some information, rights, and emotional support.

And all I can feel is shocking, overwhelming gratitude to be pregnant at this point in history.
