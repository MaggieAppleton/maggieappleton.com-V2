People who don't enjoy running. People who wish they enjoyed running. People who love running and want to feel connected to someone else's experience of doing it for a dozen years.

<IntroParagraph>

When I tell people I've run almost every day for the last twelve years, they hear the wrong things in it.<Footnote idName={1}>Minus 2021 when I took a year off for health issues. I chilled out a lot more after that, and now only run 4-5 times a week.</Footnote> They seem to be impressed in a warped way. Some launch into a strange self-flagellating tirade about how they could never do that, but wish they could, and begin listing all their attempts and failures. Wrapped up in all of this is a subtle attempt to put me and other runners on a moral pedestal in this interaction.

</IntroParagraph>

These exchanges make abundantly clear the discourse and culture around running ruins running for everyone. People who identify as “runners” and running apps are especially guilty of ruining running for everyone (I'll get to their sins later).

You've almost certainly been taught all the wrong things about the _point_ of running. You've probably been taught that running is a moral act. That doing it or not doing it reflects on the goodness of your soul, your ability to endure hard things, and how much you care about your health. That it's something painful but necessary that you _should_ do to serve the gods of personal and public health, fitness, and weight management.

You've probably also internalised some accompanying beliefs; that you have to do it “properly” by keeping a 5:30/km pace, continuing for at least 30+ minutes, paying attention to your stride, tracking your time and distance, wearing the right shoes, uploading everything to Strava, and signing up for organised races to achieve PRs.<Footnote idName={2}>Personal records. Not pull request, you nerds.</Footnote>

To me, this is all a bunch of joy-killing crap. These unfun expectations and norms turn running into some over-quantified, chore-like, implicit competition between you and everyone around you.

This makes me sad for everyone. Because, in my experience, the _point_ of running isn't health, weight loss, moral superiority, social approval, or stoic training.

The point is that it's purely, selfishly, indulgently, **one of the best drugs I've ever taken**. If I go on a run, within fifteen minutes I am _ecstatic_ to be alive. I am drugged up on endorphins, seratonin, and dopamine, and flying through the world like a child.

Every time I get an empty stretch of pavement with no one around me, I break into a giant grin. I not in my right mind. I am singing along to trashy dance hits like [Came Here for Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/4tiTh1MONBC5WqhkB9ZyS4?si=37aa30e2c6814c02), out loud, and sprinting down the open stretch at full speed. I feel primordial. Like some deep, basic, primitive part of me who has no other outlet is finally allowed to breathe.

Much like your classic drugs – cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines, whathaveyou – running lets me easily slip a state of immature bliss.<Footnote idName={3}>I'm not suggesting I've ever taken these illegal and dangerous drugs, but if in a hypothetical world I had, I would be able to say from lots of experience that the qualia is similar.</Footnote> But unlike said questionable substances, this high is freely available at all times, super cheap, has no comedown or hangover, and no risk of amassing a criminal record. It's roughly 20% of an MDMA hit for 0.2% of the cost.

This happens 9 out of 10 times for me. On the remaining fraction of runs, I am either sleep deprived, sick, slightly out of shape from being sick, and/or this run is happening in freezing rain and strong winds pointed directly at me, and I am not dressed properly. Those runs are a bit crap, but I just turn around and go home after ten minutes, because what is the point? I'm only here for the drug, and the drug is not working today.

I can count on one hand the number of times I've gone on a run and regretted it or felt worse afterwards. Every other time has been overhelmingly net positive. On shitty days it is my reflex emotional comfort blanket, one I would struggle to go without.

Which brings me to my persuasion game.

I believe there are scores of would-be runners in the world who have “failed” to take up running because of the poisonously moral, judgemental, and competitive spirit of running culture. Because it is implicitly or explicitly forced on them as a health or weight obligation. 

They don't realise there is a plethora of joyful, freeing, and emotionally comforting qualia on offer.


## Where's Your Evidence for Drugged Up Running?

If the point of this note is to convince you running is a drug worth doing, what evidence do I have that you'll actually feel good on it?

In short, I don't have that evidence. Running feels very drug-like to me. But I can't claim anyone other than me experiences it this way. I can only account for my subjective experience, but not All Human Experience. 

That said, how unique can my biology be? 

You've probably heard of “runner's high.” 

There's a phenomenon called “runner's high” that scientists have been investigating since XXXX. The findings are pretty shaky.

[evidence and discussion of what happens when people run] [Runners high is disputed in the scientific literature]

Some people claim they have never felt joy and delight while running. I don't want to invalidate their experience – I have no doubt they genuinely feel pain, boredom, and fatigue when starting out.

But I have some suspicion this is because they've never gotten their running stamina up high enough to experience what it's like to run without pain and suffering. It's certainly uncomfortable in the beginning. Your body needs to get used to doing this new thing, and it will resist at first. 

But once you cross that threshold of fitness and stamina, you unlock a new mode. You now have a reliable way to trigger physical joy, calmness, and pleasure, without suffering any pain for it. There is no hangover or comedown or long term health cost. Quite the opposite. Nothing hurts and everything is beautiful.


## Starting Out and Raising Stamina

So... how do you get over the threshold?

Some of you will be thinking “this all sounds good in theory, but you're saying I have to endure months of pain to reach this hypothetical free drug?”

I can't speak to how other people's bodies feel. I don't actually know if your brain will release the same chemicals mine does. I don't know if it'll stop feeling pain once you build up stamina. Logically, it seems like it would, but I can't pretend everyone has the same physiology.

I can only tell you I went from hating running, and finding it full of suffering, pain, and bordeom, to runs consistently being the best part of most days for me. I changed two things in between; I stopped thinking of it as a way to control my body, and I slowed way down.

Hopefully this is good news to some of you: running is an ineffective way to lose weight. Exercise in general is pretty ineffective. So there's no point running in order to lose weight, or control the way your body looks. Science says so. [links to studies]

For me, this fact is liberating. It was even more liberating to have my body prove it. Despite all my running, my weight hasn't fluctuated more than a kilo in years.

I had to realise the point of running was purely to have a good time. Period. This is the most important goal above all others, and governs everything about how I run. My joy and happiness is the goal. Everything else is tangential.

The point is not to control the way my body looks, because it won't work, and that's a dumb goal for me to fixate on. It's not to improve my health and longevity, although that is a nice side benefit. It's not to look superior on Strava, because no one gives a crap what I put on Strava. It's not to “beat my old self” – I do that in other aspects of my life, but not this one.



## The Joy of Going Slow

If I have any magical secrets to share on how to enjoy running more, build up your stamina, and achieve drug-like highs, it's just this: run extremely slowly.

How slowly? Slow enough that running isn't painful and unpleasant. This probably means doing walk-jog intervals for a while when you start out.

I found the best way to measure this is by tracking your heart rate. You heart rate is a good indicator of how hard your body is working. Hard-working bodies complain by making you feel pain. They protest by making your lungs burn, your legs wobble, and your side cramp. If you go easier on your body, it will cause you less pain, and you'll have a better time.

If the point of the run if for you to have a good time, then you don't need to go fast. You don't need to run the whole time.
