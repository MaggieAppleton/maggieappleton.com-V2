<IntroParagraph>

This past July I joined [Normally](https://normally.com/), a London-based design and prototyping studio focused on applied AI. The move has been overwhelming positive for me, in ways I both expected and didn't.

First off, I now get to be a full-time, official Senior [[Design Engineer]], rather than a product designer that keeps invading on the engineering work. The “Design Engineer” label is still young, tenative, and contested, but it fits well enough for now. I [do this thing]. Spending more time touching code has made me happier on an hourly basis. I still have plenty of engineering skills to learn, but it's fun to sit at the bottom of a learning curve. I'm far more excited to get to grips with serverless functions and LLM reasoning chains than I ever was about user research methods or rigorous design documentation.

Second, I underestimated how much being around like-minded people in a physical space affects my motivation, happiness, and connection to colleagues at work. Normally, like most companies now, is still hybrid – we only go into the office 1-2 days a week. But the days in are full
