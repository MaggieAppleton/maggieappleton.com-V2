<h2 className="micro">The Context</h2>

When users can enter a value that may be calculated from other variables and formulas in the systems.

<h2 className="micro">The Pattern</h2>

Visually structure the formula to split areas into labelled sections. Sometimes with autocomplete and dropdown menus to improve discoverability and visibility.

I waffled for a while on what to name this. There's no industry-standard term, and there's a few ways we might interpret what's important about the pattern.

I settled on ”Visual expression editors” because it felt like it captured the important aspects. _Visual_ to emphasise that the pattern relies on graphical and spatial qualities to define various parts of the expression.

_Expression_ is techically the correct term for the actual thing people are writing here. To cite the Wikipedia official definition:

<BlockquoteCitation
  author="Wikipedia"
  title="Expressions (Computer Science)"
  url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)"
>
  "A syntactic entity in a programming language that may be evaluated to
  determine its value. It is a combination of one or more constants, variables,
  functions, and operators that the programming language interprets"
</BlockquoteCitation>

The other options were to call it a “formula” or “query” which are similar concepts, but not quite as accurate. Expressions can contain formulas. Expressions may end up being queries to a database, but they themselves are not the query.

And _Editor_ captured the fact these are things you can dynamically edit as an end-user, rather than simply being static representations.
