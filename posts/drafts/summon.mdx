<IntroParagraph>

I recently spent a weekend summoning spirits. Not the supernatural kind. But the algorithmic kind. At a prototypical remote cabin out in the California woods, a small group of us gathered around a cluster of Macbook Pros and built a thing.

</IntroParagraph>

We called it **Summon**.<Footnote idName={1}>We originally named it “Kevin,” but eventually decided that didn't have the right branding vibes. “Summon” is a handy acronymn for its full name: <b>Summon Unlimited Machine Magic on Notes</b></Footnote> Summon is a place where you can write notes. Every note has a litte spirit inside it (or “agent” if you like more traditional AI terminology). This spirit is like a moderately intelligent human who has read your note. When you summon a spirit, it can tell you all about the note it lives in.

It can summarise its contents in a few words.

It can answer questions about it.

It can rephrase what you've written in a different tone of voice.

Or a different language.

It can write more about your topic.

It can point our flaws in your argument.

Or challenge your claims.

Spirits can also read other notes in your system. This gives them more context to answer your questions and generate ideas. You can ask the spirit in your **Medieval food** note to read your **Favourite recipes** note, then recommend some 16th-century-themed meals you might enjoy.

Above all, the spirits are meant to help you _reflect_ on your thoughts. They're assistants for thinking. They certainly cannot think _for_ you. And the level of sophistication in these systems is still reasonably low. You have to approach them with a bit of lateral thinking to get interesting results.

Asking a spirit to “write a 1000 word essay about quantum computing”

I'm clearly being coy and flippant with my supernatural language. To clarify, a “spirit” is an instance of a GPT-3 request. You type an instruction in natural language, and we fire off a request to [GPT-3 Instruct](); an API provided by the [OpenAI]() foundation.

## The backstory

We were all interested in overlapping topics; research workflows, personal and collaborative knowledge, the evolution of “note-taking”, machine learning, and natural language processing.

I had previously written about the emerging pattern of [[Programmable Notes]] – note-taking systems that allow users to define their own programmatic logic and algorithmic interactivity.

[Linus](https://thesephist.com/) had written about [AI as a collaborator](https://thesephist.com/posts/ai-collaborator/) and [notational representations](https://thesephist.com/posts/notation/) for dynamic systems. [Paul](https://paulbricman.com/) had built [Dual](https://paulbricman.com/thoughtware/dual): a GPT-3 plugin for the Obsidian note-taking ecosystem. [David](https://twitter.com/dmdohan) had been [thinking about](https://youtu.be/Oxbv9EnhSuk?t=202) using NLP as “a natural language IDE for thought”. And the whole team at [Ought](https://ought.org) – our generous hosts for the event – have been [building tools](https://elicit.org/search) to improve open-ended reasoning for researchers using ML / NLP.

I explored this idea in [[Programmable Notes]] – a reflection on the emerging pattern of note-taking apps that allow users to add programmatic logic into their systems.

We built a prototype of an AI assistant that can help you write reflective notes. We call it Summon. It uses the GPT-3 Instruct API to generate text based on your input.

Yes, many parts of this post were written by the Summon spirits, and not me. I doubt you can tell the difference. Welcome to the age of human-AI co-authorship.
