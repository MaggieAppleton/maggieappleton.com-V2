## Introduction

I've just finished up an illustrated data story in collaboration with <a href="http://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a> and want to share how it came together.

The Pudding is a data visualisation-focused publication who make impressive, <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/">interactive scrollytelling</a> stories. I've admired their work for years, and enthusiastically got chatting to Pudding Journalist-Engineer <a href="https://pudding.cool/author/caitlyn-ralph/">Caitlyn Ralph</a> at the recent <a href="https://encode.info//">encode.info</a> conference here in London.

While their stories are usually full-screen web experiences, she mentioned they'd recently started experimenting with a new format on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pudding.cool/">Instagram</a>.
Called The Pudding, etc, it's a mobile-native, hand-drawn, mini-data-story approach. Here's a couple of their previous ones:

I love this idea of presenting data in a more simplified and accessible medium compared to the big, flashy, javascript-heavy "infographics" all over the web. Given that my sketch style fit their approach, working on one of these felt like a perfect collaboration opportunity.

## Pitching the Story

The Pudding have an open pitch policy – anyone is free to submit article ideas. Submission run through their weekly "Story Time" review process which is nicely documented in an open-access wiki on Github

I'd been sitting on an idea about the climate impact of dairy vs. plant milks for a few weeks that felt like a good candidate. I'd originally found it through the BBC article Climate change: Which vegan milk is best?

Here's the TLDR; in 2018 two researchers at Oxford ran some numbers on the environmental impact of all kinds of foods – cheese, tofu, mutton, peas, and more.

From that study the BBC picked out the milk data and made a tiny bar chart on it:
