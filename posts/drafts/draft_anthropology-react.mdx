#### A talk I original presented at React Rally 2020

## Magic, Kinship, and Ritual Among Developers

I've been immersed in the world of React developers since 2016

React through a slightly different lens through the lens of cultural anthropology. 

### What _is_ "React"?

This is important because I think it’s going to help us answer a question about what “React” is.

I am sure you’ve had a number of people ask you this question, from outside the industry.

I don’t know about you, but I’ve never been able to come up with an answer that feels complete and fitting that explains to people who aren’t involved in the web world - which is most humans on earth - why React matters, and why there are so many people obsessed with it.

### Just a JavaScript library?

There’s one way to answer this question. We can just read the docs, and take that as the “official definition.”“It’s just a javascript library for building user interfaces”


Seeing React as a cultural community, rather than simply a technological tool helps us 
Defining React as "the technical definition" puts it in a reductive box.

It's not a holistic definition that helps us understand the historical and cultural context of React.

What happens if we expand our understanding to include all the people who surround this technical box, and how they might __affect__ and __be affected by__ what's inside it? What if we entertain the idea that humans and the culture of React are an essential part of what defines React?

What if we consider it a cultural ecosystem we're _active participants_ in, rather than simply a package we `npm install`

Cultural anthropology is perfectly placed to help us find answers to these questions. 

## What is cultural anthropology?

If you have never head of "cultural anthropology" before, don't fret, we're one of those odd disciplines stuffed in the back corner behind sociology.

In essence, it's the study of human cultures, and trying to figure out how they work.

A far more poetic definition from one of my favourite anthropologists [Tim Ingold]():

> Philosophy with the people in it

Anthropology concerns itself with the same ideas philosophers do 

Anthropology the way I've been indoctrinated with it focuses on the particular aspects of certain cultures.

It isn't searching for one universal truth of all humanity, but rather particular truths for particular people, at particular points in time.

## Who is "The React Community"?

#### How do we define our group? Who do we think is part of it?

## React is an Imagined Community

Rather than talking about stats and numbers, it’s much more meaningful for us to talk about React an an imagined community.

This was a concept developed by a political scientist called Benedict Anderson in the 1980’s.

Anderson was writing about how nations imagine themselves as collective wholes, but his theory maps very well to how online communities like React work.

This idea of an imagined community says that we all each individually imagine the React community in our heads.

It has nothing to do with it being imaginary in the sense of being fake, but simply that it’s something we have to mentally construct across thousands of individual minds. It gets built through shared images and rituals.

Anderson specifically uses the idea of a national daily newspaper.

The act of sitting down and reading the daily news, and imagining a whole nation of other people, similar like you, sitting and reading those exact same words at roughly the same time, creates a sense of collective belonging

It’s a daily ritual that reaffirms your membership, and sense of unity with a greater whole.
