{cube drawing}

For anyone learning to draw, getting good at boxes and cubes is one of the most important foundational skills. Being able to draw a box in three dimensional space is the first step in being able to draw anything well. <Footnote idName={1}><span>At least in terms of formal perspective and constructive drawing. There are many ways, styles, and approaches to drawing. This is only one.</span><br/><br/><span>It's the traditional bandwagon I was trained in, and that I personally like riding around on. You are free to hitch yourself to whichever drawing bandwagon you please.</span></Footnote>

Since practice makes perfect, many people take on the challenge of drawing hundreds of boxes in order to improve their drawing skills.
It's a trend that's been popularised by sites like [Draw a Box](https://drawabox.com/), which has its learners [draw 250 boxes](https://drawabox.com/lesson/250boxes) as one of their first assignments.

Profilic box drawing is a core part of many of the educational [resources I recommend](/resources) to people. I worked through my fair share of them while taking [Peter Han](https://www.instagram.com/peterhanstyle/)'s **Dynamic Sketching** course, <Footnote idName={2}>Peter now teaches the same course material [online](https://peterhanstyle.artstation.com/projects/XB5D1L?album_id=1673541) and has published the many of the princicples in his book [The Dynamic Bible](https://peterhanstyle.myshopify.com/products/dynamic-bible?variant=46561311765)</Footnote> and other foundational drawing courses at [Concept Design Academy](http://conceptdesignacad.com/) in LA.

## The Missing Box Pieces 

While drawing boxes sounds simple enough, many of the online tutorials and guides are incomplete explanations of how perspective works. That's the primary point of boxes - they teach you how to construct a 3D form in linear perspective.

Many of the online tutorials are aimed at beginners, and chucking anyone into a dense explanation of technical perspective is the easiest way to murder their interest in drawing.

So most of the articles and YouTube videos you'll stumble on skip over the details, which leads to predictable mistakes and confusion later on.

The principles of technical perspective are something you build up to when you're ready for them. After you've gotten comfortable making smooth lines and basic shapes, but begin to notice your boxes never look quite right.

How are you supposed to know where to put the lines?  
What's the right angle for the corners?  
How do you check if it's even correct or not?

The confusion comes from missing a bigger picture understanding. It's like trying to follow a delicate cake recipe when you don't understand baking chemistry and ingredient ratios. One small change in temperature or egg sizes and you're pulling a deflated souffle out of the oven.

I've written up a [Quicky and Dirty Guide to Perspective]()...

I've picked out the five most common mistakes that are consistent across people's work, and the clarified the misunderstandings that cause them.

## The Five Most Common Box Mistakes

1. Lines that don't converge



2. Lines that converge too quickly

This is far and away the most common mistake.
One of the cumbersome details of perspective drawing is that the scale of the grid is enourmous.

This is caused by placing your vanishing points too close together.

It makes everything look like it's being viewed through an extreme close up shot. Dramatic foreshortening.

What's happening here is the extreme-looking corners falls outside the normal human cone of vision.


3. Vanishing points don't share a level horizon line.

If these don't align, it means your horizon line is tilted. It's fine, but its better than you're doing it intentionally for dramatic effect rather than as a technical misunderstanding.

Tilted horizon lines are called "[dutch angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_angle)" in film composition and tend to be used for specific narrative effects. It's how the world looks when your head is tilter to one side.

4. You don't know where the horizon line is

5. Back edges extend too far

This one only applies if you're trying to draw cube where all the sizes of the box are of equal wdith and height â€“ rather than any old shapes of box.

I'm pointing it out because to draw well you will at some point need to learn to draw a roughly correct cube.

## In Pursuit of Better Boxes

There's a few techniques you can practice to get better at boxes I haven't seen mentioned around much.

First, tracing.

If you don't have the basic forms of a cube in working memory, drawing them is going to be quite the challenge. Tracing over 3D references of cubes will help ease you into the feel of drawing them from memory.

Reference images of real-world, box-like objects. This helps transition you into drawing things other tha just plain boring boxes.

The world is filled with boxy objects. Doing studies from reference photos will make use of your box-drawing skills, but apply them to more interesting material.
