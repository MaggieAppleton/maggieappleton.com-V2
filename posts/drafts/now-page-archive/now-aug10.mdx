A regularly updated log of what I'm currently focused on.  
More stable than a twitter feed, and less permanent then the [about](/about) page. <Footnote idName={1}>Now pages are a [growing thing.](https://nownownow.com/about) Make one for yourself!</Footnote>

<br/>

- Researching [[Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]] and [[Pattern Languages]] for ad-hoc learning groups and reading collectives. Heavily inspired by the principles laid out in the [[The Knowledge Hydrant]], and seeking ways to expand on them.
- Applying said research to new learning models at [egghead](https://egghead.io/). We're experimenting with **Knowledge Adventure Clubs** and **Cascading Book Groups** based around [[Understanding by Design]] principles.
- Enthusiastically preparing to start a part-time Masters degree in [Digital Anthropology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc) at UCL in September (yes... probably on Zoom)
- Collaborating with [New Harvest](https://www.new-harvest.org/) on a series of illustrated explanations around cultivated meat & cellular agriculture - showcasing their current [research fellows](https://www.new-harvest.org/current_research_projects).
- Frantically compiling a large sprawl of notes into a coherent talk for [React Rally](https://www.reactrally.com/) in August
- Reading with, learning from, and hanging out around [InterIntellects](https://www.interintellect.com/), [Yaks](https://www.yakcollective.org/), and [Digital Gardeners](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)

### Keen to Discuss

- [Performing Magical Capitalism](https://www.epicpeople.org/performing-magical-capitalism/) - Capitalist cultural structures map perfectly onto our anthropological understandings of magical rites and formulas.

- [Stuart Russell on the 80,000 Hours Podcast](https://www.breaker.audio/80000-hours-podcast-with-rob-wiblin/e/66223732) - UC Berkley professor of computer science and author of [Human Compatible](https://www.librarything.com/work/23714642) on why the way we approach machine learning and AI today is fundamentally flawed.
