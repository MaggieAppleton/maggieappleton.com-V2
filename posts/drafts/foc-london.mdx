<IntroParagraph>

For the past three years I've been running the [Future of Coding meetup](https://lu.ma/foclondon) here in London. I put on five events a year, depending on bandwidth. Roughly one every 2-3 months. While I adore the people, events themselves, and community vibes, I need to take a little break from running it next year while I'm on maternity leave.

</IntroParagraph>

From February to ~October of 2025, I need to hand the event over to a few other people to run. As such, I thought it useful to write an in-depth guide on how these event come together. Both as a reference point for the people who will take over, and for others who want to know what running a community event entails. Some of the tactics I've developed may be useful if you want to run your own event. I'd also suggest reading my note on community [[Gathering Structures]].

## The Basics

The London [Future of Coding meetup](https://lu.ma/foclondon) is the local chapter of the larger [Future of Coding](https://futureofcoding.org/) organisation. We follow their [code of conduct](https://github.com/futureofcoding/code-of-conduct) and the community is united around the philosophies and principles they promote, specifically this:

<SimpleCard>
	<span class="small-caps blue">The Future of Coding Philosophy</span>
	<p>
		We are unified in the belief that the common practice of programming is
		tragically less humane than it could be. There's a world of possibilities
		that get more beautiful the further away from the norm you go. We’re here to
		explore this world together, to discuss ideas about theory and practice, and
		to champion and support our members’ research and development efforts to
		reimagine computing.
	</p>
</SimpleCard>

The online community has a [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/futureofcoding/shared_invite/zt-2bxrongqa-21C1dpgatX8srAGJKWtjYA), a [newsletter](https://newsletter.futureofcoding.org/), and a regular [podcast](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/) that help people get up to speed with this philosophy and its history.

Our in-person meetups are an extension of the online group; they're for people in or near London and interested in humane computing, end-user programming, and experimental interfaces to meet one another. As well as a chance to learn more about the community mission and share demos of what they're working on.

Not to boast, but we're the only regular and consistent Future of Coding meetup in the world. Nominal mention goes to San Fransisco and New York who occassionally gather as well.

## Vibes

Vibes are very important. Future of Coding is special and beautiful because the vibes are friendly, playful, and welcoming.

In all your communication with people, and actions at the event, you should be generous, open, and making sure everyone has a good time. Assume the best in people, invite everyone in warmly, and make sure everyone feels part of the group.

It is intentionally non-corporate and slightly impractical. The best talks are silly improv shows that happen to have some cool programming aspects to them. You can still have a serious philosophical mission and care about what you're demo-ing while doing a silly improv show.

This is not a recruiting or corporate event because every single other tech meetup is a recruiting or corporate event. We need one small area of respite.

It's by programmers, for programmers, as a place to show scrappy fiddles and be sincerely enthusiastic about humane computing.

## Securing a Time and Place (4-6 weeks before)

We currently host the event at [Newspeak House](https://newspeak.house/) which is both philosophically aligned with the Future of Coding _and_ helps keep our expenses manageable. Win win. It's a great space. They have an overhead projector, mics and speakers, drinks fridge, tables and chairs, and the all-important gong to get everyone's attention.

It's important that we treat this space well so we can keep using it. That means the basics like being respectful to the people who run it and cleaning up properly after events. But also helping promote their goals, encouraging community members to check out other events at the venue, and donating to them.

About a month in advance, check what dates they have open. I try to schedule events between Thursday-Sunday where possible so that people who are travelling in can make a long weekend out of it. We get a surprising number of people who fly or train in from various European cities to attend the meetup.

## Announcing the Event (4-6 weeks before)

We use [Luma](https://lu.ma/home) to manage our event announcements and guest list. We have a [community calendar](https://lu.ma/foclondon) on there that people can subscribe to. All new events should be made on that calendar.

The easiest way to do this is the clone a previous FoC event and update the details. You can then invite people who subscribe to our calendar and everyone who's previously attended an FoC event.

Set the max guest capacity to 150 people. 150 people won't actually show up. About 80-100 will. <Footnote idName={1}>Unless it's cold and raining. Then it's more like 60-80.</Footnote> This is the right amount of people for this meetup. Any bigger and it starts to feel crammed and impersonal in the event space. There will always be people on the waitlist. Some of these people will send you messages complaining they didn't get a ticket. While I feel for these people, the only fair way to run this thing is first-come, first-serve. <Footnote idName={2}>Pro-tip for attendees: if you _really_ want to come, a guaranteed way to get a spot is to volunteer to help run the event.</Footnote> Tell the sad people without tickets to check back on the day of the event when spots will likely open up.

Speaking of giving people a chance to get a ticket, once the event is live on Luma, post it to the #in-london channel of the Future of Coding Slack. I also post it to Twitter and Bluesky which helps people find it.

## Ordering Drinks and Snacks (4 weeks before)

Order drinks and snacks from Tesco online grocery – they seem to have the best deals and most delivery slots. Delivery slots go quick though, so you'll want to book at least a month in advance. Schedule the delivery for 5-6pm on the event date.

I order half alcoholic drinks and half non-alcoholic. Always a mix of different beers and soft drinks, depending on which ones are on sale / have discounts. I'm not personally a beer-drinker, but I've been told it's acceptable to order San Miguel, Birra Moretti, Guiness, Corona, and Stella Artois. Consult your own beer-drinkers for advice on what brands are palatable. For soft drinks I do a mix of Ginger Beer, Lemonade, and Orange Fanta.

Assuming 80 guests, get 2x drinks per person, or 160 drinks. Tesco limits the amount of alcohol you can purchase and it's about this much anyway.

I usually throw in a few bags of tortilla chips, flavoured nuts, and crips for snacks, since these are so cheap they only add £10 to the final bill and help tide people over.

This usually comes to between £110-150, including delivery.

Newspeak sometimes has leftover drinks in their fridge from previous events which helps pad this out, but don't count on it.

## Getting a Sponsor (4 weeks before)

Sponsors cover the cost of food and drinks. It costs £500 to sponsor a single event, which safely covers pizza and drinks with a bit of extra cushion. For some events I've only been able to rustle up £200-300 and needed to fall back on previous funds to cover costs.

Companies who sponsor get a 15-20 minute speaking slot where they can demo their product and/or put out a recruiting call for developers. They can also put stickers/flyers on the tables, and we list them in the event description.

We're lucky to have a bunch of philosophically-aligned companies connected to the Future of Coding. Many dedicated members of the community have ended up founding startups, and have then been able to turn around and sponsor us with their glorious VC funding, such as [TLdraw](https://www.tldraw.com/), [PartyKit](https://www.partykit.io/), [Jazz](https://jazz.tools/), and more.

We've also recieved some funding from larger, well-established companies, but we could probably use more of this. Developer tooling companies are a good potential target.

I will be the first to admit I'm not the most financially savvy community organiser or skilled at filling our community coffers, so would love someone else to come in and excel in this department!

## Gathering, Selecting, and Confirming Speakers (2-3 weeks before)

The meat of the Future of Coding meetup is the demos.

On the Luma event page, add a link to the demo application form. I use Airtable to manage this.

## Sending Email Reminders (72 hours before)

Luma makes it easy to send out scheduled email reminders. I set these to 72 hours and 24 hours ahead of time. People might RSVP a month in advance and then completely forget they did so. The email reminders help jog people's memories, and give them a chance to cancel their RSVP if needed.

A good chunk of people will cancel their RSVP's in the 24 hours before the event. This is a good thing. It opens up spots for people who are on the waitlist. There are always far more people on the waitlist than we can accomodate.

## Ordering Food (48 hours before)

My reliable approach to feeding everyone has been pizza. Use Deliveroo or Uber Eats to schedule a delivery to the meetup. Recently I've been ordering from Tre Colori because the pizza is good, decently priced, and they deliver on time. We used to order from Pizza Union which was super cheap but tasted like cardboard. We upgraded.

You can browse around the delivery apps to find good deals, but my rule of thumb is find somewhere with margaritas under £11. It's not the time for fancy pizza (unless we start to rake in that sweet VC sponsorship).

I usually get 30 pizzas for 80+ people, which is roughly 0.375 pizzas per person. This should come to £300-350. Get a couple vegan and gluten-free ones.

Schedule the delivery for 6:45-7:15pm. This is in the middle of the meetup, which means you'll need someone in charge of collecting the pizza as they arrive while talks are happening.

This can be a quite a process as they usually come via 5-6 delivery bikes, and you need to accept each one in turn. Deliveroo makes it easy to track their arrival times and see how close they are.

If you can think of a cheaper, tastier way to feed 80+ people, feel free to experiment. In fact, for our upcoming [festive event](https://lu.ma/6wesen56), I'm trying out a smorgasboard approch with lots of finger food, crackers, meats and cheeses, olives, etc. It's looking like it'll be marginally cheaper than pizza. So if people like it and don't go hungry, maybe switch to that.

## On the Event Day

Arrive at Newspeak / the location by 5pm to help setup. Receive the Tesco order and put drinks in the fridge. Put snacks out on tables. Carry tables and chairs up from the basement if needed. Help set them up. Write the event name on the chalkboard and put it outside. Make yourself familiar with how the projector, mic, and audio input cables work.

As people start to arrive, sit at the table at the front, welcome them, and ask everyone to make a nametage (yes we're pro-nametags). Newspeak has nametag stickers and pens. Point them to where they can put coats/bags and grab a drink.

Once it hits 6:30, begin the first round of demos. The evening schedule usually looks like this:

6-6:30 Attendees arrive and settle in  
6:30-7:30 Welcome and community introduction, then first round of demos  
7:30-8 Food and drinks break  
8-8:30 Second round of demos  
8:30 onwards people hang out, finish the drinks, ask speakers questions, and continue doing over-the-shoulder demos

Before the first demos, give a short introduction to what this community is and show the main website on the projector. This is also the time to thank sponsors and Newspeak/your location hosts, and mention any housekeeping info.

For each person demo-ing, introduce them, then help them get plugged in to the HDMI / USB-C cable and audio if they need it. Check the mic stand matches their height.

The crowd usually thins out by 10, which is when I tend to head home. People can stay later, but before you leave, do a good sweep of the room putting cans in recycling bins and picking up rubbish. Fold chairs and break down tables as well if Newspeak needs that done (they'll tell you).

The late night folks tend to migrate to nearby pubs in the area, and are usually helpful with doing the final clean-up before trickling out.

## After the Event

Submit receipts for food and drinks to Open Collective for reimbursement. Make sure you've collected sponsorship money.

I used to post pictures to Twitter in a big thread, including other people's pictures and video clips. Now that a large chunk of the web community is moving away from the slowly-burning-Elon-hellspace and onto Bluesky, that feels like a better platform to post a wrap-up thread. It also has more community-friendly features like the ability to make custom feeds based off hashtags or keywords.

Publishing a proper summary of events and making it easy for attendees to see pictures and find links to people who demoed is a thing we should really have. I've never quite managed to create a streamlined system for this and instead do it haphazardly. Please improve on this.

## Finances

I manage the meetup finances through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/future-of-coding-london). Anyone can contribute donations or sponsorship funds through the platform, and we're able to submit receipts for expenses in a transparent way.

We're an “independent collective” on Open Collective, which means we manage our own funds, accounting, taxes, and bank account. We hold the community funds in a [treasurer's bank account](https://www.lloydsbank.com/business/business-accounts/treasurers-account.html) with Lloyds. It's specficially designed for social clubs and communities. It's connected to the Open Collective account, so any expenses submitted there can be repaid from that account. Sponsorship funds are also paid directly into that account.

Because the bank account has my name on it, it feels too complex to figure out how to pass this part off to someone else. I'll still be available to approve expense reimbursements on Open Collective and coordinate getting sponsorship funds deposited into the account.

## The Future of the Future of Coding

I'm really hoping a solid group of people step up to take over this meetup and make it their own while I'm busy keeping a small human alive. The people in this community are genuinely the most unique and special developer snowflakes who deserve a space to showcase their work and meet one another.

I would be thrilled if it flourished in my absence. I am too much of a linchpin at the moment and need to spread the community responsibilies and ownership among a wider, more robust group of people. Perhaps some sort of small committee. Maybe one day we could get even t-shirts.
