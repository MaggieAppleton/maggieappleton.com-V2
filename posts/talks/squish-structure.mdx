<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/squish-structure/sms_2.jpeg">

My name is Maggie, and I work as a product designer at an AI research lab called Ought. I also have some experience as a developer and a cultural anthropologist. My design work is heavily influenced by my training as an anthropologist, as well as my interest in tools for thought and end-user programming. Over the past year, I've been working with language models, specifically in the field of AI alignment and safety.

At Ought, we are a research lab but also a product lab. We focus on building useful AI products while also considering alignment and safety. Our team has been working with language models since 2018, well before the current hype cycle. They have developed a strong opinion on how to build with these models, and I've been fortunate to learn from them.

Our main product is called Elicit, which is a research tool powered by language models. It has been running for two years and has Over a hundred thousand users.

</TalkSlide>

Elicit is primarily used by full-time researchers who need to do literature reviews. It helps them understand the current state of a field or topic by analyzing and summarizing relevant papers.

This talk is mostly going to be about why language models are such a mysterious, finicky, pain in the ass to design with.

</TalkSlide>

<TalkSlide imgSrc="/images/posts/squish-structure/sms_7.jpeg">

I'll also share some useful mental models for reasoning about language models, explore the tension between traditional programming and language models, and discuss how we can design models to be specialized reasoning engines.
