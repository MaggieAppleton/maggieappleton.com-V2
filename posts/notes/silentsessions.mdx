<IntroParagraph>

There's an established concept called **Silent Meetings**. Much like it sounds, it's a meeting where for the most part no one talks.

</IntroParagraph>

Rather than one PowerPoint dictator lecturing to a room full of checked-out people, silent meetings shift discussion into online collaborative documents.

Everyone sits quietly on their own device and comments on a **"Table Read"** â€“ a shared document in Google Docs or Figma or a webpage annotated with <a href="https://hypothes.is">Hypothes.is</a>

People add comments and discussion points to the document directly. They're able to easily refer to specific parts, respond to other people's comments, and **run multiple threaded discussions**. Instead of one leader or instructor talking **at** many people, it's many people all talking **to** each other.

David Gasca wrote up a <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-silent-meeting-manifesto-v1-189e9e3487eb">comprehensive manifesto</a> on the phenomenon in <YearsAgo>2019</YearsAgo> that dives into the implementation details for using them at companies.

While it's a great concept for Corporateland, I'm keen to explore how we could use it for collaborative learning communities online.

Many of my [[Cozy Web]] communities are full of voracious readers. We're often looking for ways to run ad-hoc book clubs and reading groups, but the established formats are fairly vanilla. Standard Zoom calls. Or async stream discussions in Slack-esque apps.

The tools are janky. The [[Pattern Languages]] aren't well established. Systems like [[the Knowledge Hydrant]] give us good starting points, but aren't designed with an online environment in mind.

One challenge of distributed learning is the coordination around timing. **Async reading doesn't focus collective attention in one place at one time.**

Picking a single time to 'meet' in a document gives people a structured frame to fully focus on reading, thinking, and discussing

The opportunity to follow up with a video or voice call right after also creates space for social bonding, nuanced conversations, and collaborative meaning-making. It prevents Twitter-esque brutality and presumptive misunderstandings.

I'm beginning to try this out. TBD
