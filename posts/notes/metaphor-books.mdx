<IntroParagraph>

My obsession with metaphor isn't original, it's genetically inherited. My mother <a href='http://www.thelibrarianedge.com/'>Katie Day</a> planted all the original seeds. The paperback copies of [Metaphors We Live By](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Metaphors_We_Live_By/m8Sp5m9vZcwC) and [Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Women_Fire_and_Dangerous_Things/CfCnzSF9de8C) are visceral childhood memories as much as they're current intellectual kindling.

As a teacher and librarian, her research focuses on using metaphors in pedagogy, digital literacy, and information science. But our worlds overlap in the more fundamental obsession with how we can use metaphors to communicate ideas to others.

We started collecting <a href="https://www.librarything.com/list/20481/all/Metaphors-etc">a metaphorical reading list</a> a few years back that I just rediscovered.
