<IntroParagraph>

My obsession with metaphor isn't original, it's genetically inherited. My mother <a href='http://www.thelibrarianedge.com/'>Katie Day</a> planted all the original seeds. The paperback copies of [Metaphors We Live By](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Metaphors_We_Live_By/m8Sp5m9vZcwC) and [Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Women_Fire_and_Dangerous_Things/CfCnzSF9de8C) are visceral childhood memories as much as they're current intellectual kindling.
