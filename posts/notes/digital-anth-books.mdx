<IntroParagraph>

As a [[Digital Anthropology]] enthusiast, I'm often asked for reading recommendations that are good entry points into the field. I've compiled a list of gateway drugs.

</IntroParagraph>

This is a collection of books, talks, documentaries, articles, and academic papers that are a mix of "essential reads," plus some of my personal picks.  
It will give you a sweeping overview of what digital anthropologists tend to spend their time thinking about and researching.

Most of them aren't overly academic, so you don't need to worry about trudging through too much Foucauldian theory or references to Marxist [reification](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(Marxism)>) (no promises though, sometimes it just comes out of left field).

  subtitle="Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism"

>

  Software advocates to try and understand the open-source software movement. He
  examines how it shifted the power dynamics of creation, and challenged who has
  authority to build and share knowledge.

>
  Dourish and Bell examine the dream of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing">
    Ubiquitous Computing
  </a>
  through an anthropological lens: as a shared cultural narrative, as a driver
  of resources and funding, and as a utopian vision that is impossibly messy in
  reality. This one is great for understanding what it means to “think
  anthropologically” about a subject.
