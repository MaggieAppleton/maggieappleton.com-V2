<AssumedAudience>

Anyone suffering from vestibular neuritis, labyrinthis, or other vestibular issues looking for some reassurance and points of comparion. Or anyone with a normal balance system curious what it's like to spend months unable to see, walk, or talk straight, and wants to read an account of my unhinged hypochondria.

<IntroParagraph>

At around 2pm on January 23rd, while on a work trip to San Fransisco, jet-lagged, staring into a screen, and trying to organise a chaotic Figma file, my brain began to malfunction. My eyes refused to focus on the shapes in front of me and my head felt like it was floating away from my body.

</IntroParagraph>

Alarmed, I thought I must be dehydrated or in a dire blood sugar crash, and headed towards the kitchen of our little co-working space. Mid-way down the corridor I fell into the wall. Or rather, veered into the wall as the floor began to spin above my head. Panicking, I ducked into the bathroom, and only remember staring at myself in the mirror, clutching the sink, and thinking I was utterly losing my mind. This must be a stroke. Or a heart attack. Or sepsis.
