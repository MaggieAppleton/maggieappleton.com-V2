<IntroParagraph>

Every profession comes with perks. Accountants rarely have to fret over taxes. Librarians get to buy books with other people's money. Nurses can administer first-aid to family and friends in a pinch. 

Programmers have access to an infinite abstraction machine that can mimic any other medium, perform expontentially complex calculations, and has recently [eaten the world]().

## Folk Interfaces

[Cristobal Scuitto](https://cristobal.space/) recently coined a term I'll be referencing for a long time: **folk interfaces.** They used it while [writing about](https://cristobal.space/writing/folk) their experiments using the browser as a media interface for local files.

Folk [comes from](https://www.etymonline.com/word/folk) the old English _folc_ meaning “common people, laity; men; people, nation, tribe; multitude; troop, army.”

In modern lanuage we use it to mean “of the common people” or “from the people.” Anything that emerges from the ground-up, from the needs and wants of regular folk, rather than from large professional, political, or commerical interests.

[Folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore) is a collection of oral stories people tell to one another. [Folk art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore) is what people make of their own accord, outside the institutions of Art, usually with an eye towards pragmatism. [Folksonomies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy) became an established term in the mid-2000's to describe informal taxonomies developed by users on social sharing platforms. Usually in the form of tags on sites like Flickr, Tumblr, and Diigo.

Folk practices is a term sometimes used in the design world to mean the creative ways people "hack" and repurpose everyday items to meet their needs. Wall juts used as tables, chairs as doorstoppers, cup handles as teabag holders, and stairs as seating.

Folk interfaces are when users reapproprate existing software to solve their own needs.


people using Spreadsheets for things like digital painting, or building a Pokemon battle simulation. People reappropriating software for their own needs, regardless of the intention of the designers.

Excel and spreadsheeting software has been one of the most significant contributions to end-user programming to date
