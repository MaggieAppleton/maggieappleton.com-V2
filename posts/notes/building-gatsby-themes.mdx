More illustrated notes, this time on [Gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/).

They're one of the newer features in [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) – little building blocks of site functionality you can mix n' match n' share on NPM.

[Chris Biscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi) made [an extensive course](https://egghead.io/courses/composable-gatsby-themes) on egghead on how to build your own.

This whole site is built in Gatsby so I'm always trying to level up my understanding of how it works under the hood. Makes it easier to play.

I also made the course illustration for this one:

My <a noTip href="/drawinginvisibles1">process for making these</a> usually sticks to Procreate, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop <Footnote idName={1}>You can read more [here](/apps) on what tools and hardware I use</Footnote>, but I experimented with some 3D rendering in Cinema 4D for this one. Certainly sped up the process a bit, though made the final look a little more stiff than usual. Trade offs.
