I've been looking into both [[Pattern Languages]] and [[Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]] over the past month.

The [Knowledge Hydrant](http://www.industriallogic.com/papers/khdraft.pdf) is where these two meet in a lovely swirl of collaborative learning and organically emergent systems.

It's a draft document written up by [Joshua Kerievsky](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKerievsky) in <YearsAgo>1999</YearsAgo>. The mini-manifesto describes a set of **Design Patterns** that people can use to set up their own indie study groups outside of formal structures like universities.

While the original focused on IRL, "co-present" <Footnote idName={1}>Getting real good at the [[Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]] buzzwords and jargon over here</Footnote> groups, I'm fascinated by how we might adapt these patterns and turn them into internet-friendly, distributed digital versions.

Here's notes on the original while I'm thinking it through...
